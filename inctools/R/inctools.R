#' inctools: a package for incidence estimation
#'
#' The inctools package uses methods described by Kassanjee, et al. 'A new general biomarker-based incidence estimator,' \emph{Epidemiology} (2012), to implement functions to calculate incidence and tests of incidence difference between two populations, as well as power and sample size constraints for differenct study scenarios.
#' abie also provides functions for calculation of mean duration of recent infection and false recency rates from assays for recent infection.
#'
#' @section inctools Functions:
#' inctools has functions \emph{frrcal} to estimate false recency rate; \emph{mdrical} to estimate mean duration or recent infection; \emph{incprops} and \emph{inccounts} to calculate estimates and confidence intervals for incidence and incidence difference, as well as other summary and inferential statistics related to the survey; \emph{sspower} to calculate sample size needed for a given power in a test of incidence difference, or vice versa; and \emph{ssprecision}, which gives sample size needed for a given precision in the incidence estimate.

#' abie: a package for assay-based incidence estimation.
#'
#' The abie package provides functions to calculate incidence and tests of incidence difference between two populations, as well as power and sample size constraints for differenct study scenarios.
#' abie also provides functions for calculation of mean duration of recent infection and false recency rates from assays for recent infection.
#'
#' @section abie Functions:
#' abie has functions \emph{frr_binomial} to estimate false recency rate; \emph{mdri_ml_binomial} to estimate mean duration or recent infection; \emph{recencyI} to calculate estimates and confidence intervals for incidence and incidence difference, as well as other summary and inferential statistics related to the survey; \emph{SSPower} to calculate sample size needed for a given power in a test of incidence difference, or vice versa; and \emph{SSCprecision}, which gives sample size needed for a given precision in the incidence estimate.

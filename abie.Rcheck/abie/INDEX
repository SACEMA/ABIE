frr_binomial            Estimate subject-level false-recent rate for a
                        given time cutoff. Each subject with any
                        observations after the time cutoff is assigned
                        a recency status according to the majority of
                        observations for that subject after the cutoff.
                        In the event of exactly half of the
                        observations being classified as recent, the
                        subject contributes a count of 0.5. The
                        function performs an exact binomial test and
                        reports the estimated probability of testing
                        recent after the cutoff, a confidence interval
                        for the proportion, the number of recent
                        results ('successes'), number of subjects
                        ('trials') and the number of data points
                        contributing to the subject-level estimate.

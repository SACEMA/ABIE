#' abie: a package for assay-based incidence estimation.
#'
#' The abie package provides functions provides functions to calculate incidence and tests of incidence difference between two populations.
#' abie also provides functions for calculation of mean duration of recent infection and false recency rates from assays for recent infection.
#'
#' @section abie Functions:
#' abie has functions frr_binomial to estimate false recency rate; mdri_ml_binomial to estimate mean duration or recent infection; recencyI to calculate estimates and confidence intervals for incidence and incidence difference, as well as other summary and inferenctial statistics related to the survey; SSPower to calculate sample size needed for a given power in a test of incidence difference, or vice versa; and SSCprecision, which gives sample size needed for a given precision in the incidence estimate.

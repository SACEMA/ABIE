Tools for Assay-Based Incidence Estimation

**This is a development repository. Not recommended for use.**

For tools to calibrate recent infection tests, visit [this repository](https://github.com/SACEMA/Recent-Infection-Test-Calibration). Spreadsheet-based tools for inferring incidence using biomarkers for 'recent infection' can be found [here](http://www.incidence-estimation.org/page/tools-for-incidence-from-biomarkers-for-recent-infection).
